Hello, I'm Janmejay, a Machine Learning Engineer with expertise in Python, Data Analysis, and Data Visualization. <br>

I hold a Master's in Machine Learning from Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey, where I honed my skills in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Big Data Technologies. Outside of work, I'm passionate about Data Visualization, believing that a picture can speak volumes. <br>

My journey in the field began as a Research and Development Engineer at Research Center Imarat, where I contributed to digital signature algorithm research and website development. Later, I gained hands-on experience as a Machine Learning Intern at Tech Explica, working on automation and data analysis projects. I've also served as a Teaching Assistant at Princeton University, helping students apply ML knowledge to real-world scenarios and collaborating with peers from MIT. <br>

Three key assets I bring to the table are: <br>
<ol type="1">
<li>Strong programming skills in Python, R, PySpark and SQL</li> 
<li>Expertise in various ML frameworks and algorithms </li>
<li>Proficiency in data visualization tools like Tableau, Looker and Power BI </li>
</ol>

Currently, my goal is to forge a career in Data Science and Machine Learning, with a focus on Data Analytics. I'm always open to collaborative opportunities and fresh perspectives, and I believe that continuous self-improvement is the key to success. <br>
